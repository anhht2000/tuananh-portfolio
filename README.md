Hello there! This is the repo that has the code for my portfolio. The code is not maintained well and I am just adding to the old code.
I know the code is a mess and the best thing is to create something new from scratch but I am not able to find the time to upgrade the full repo.
So in all, I am just updating this old code and when I do feel I am done with doing this (almost 70%), you'd see the new code. 

Cheers till then!
